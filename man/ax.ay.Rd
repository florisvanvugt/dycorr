\item{ax}{Column name that contains a person A's score on variable X}

\item{ay}{Column name that contains a person A's score on variable Y}

\description{
We start from a data table where we have scores of person A and B on variables X and Y.
Data format requirement: all dyad members need to be present in the data
once as A and once as B. That is, each dyad corresponds to two, not one, row.
The question asked here is whether a person's X value predicts their own Y value.
This is within-dyad, but it takes into account potential dependence between
values of the same dyad.
The question asked here is whether a person's X value predicts their own Y value (ax => ay).
This is within-dyad of course, but it takes into account potential dependence between
values of the same dyad.
